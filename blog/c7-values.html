  <h1>Of Pride and Happiness</h1>
  <h2>Truths not so universally acknowledged.</h2>
  <h4>March 1, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I've been assigned to talk about words I associate during times in my life when I've felt "the happiest" and the "proudest." Here's the thing: they don't overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pride, for me, is almost always a byproduct of misery. I worked like a dog for two weeks straight, but I finally got that project done. I have bright-red callouses on my fingertips, but I can really nail that G chord. I've been staring at my screen so long that the numbers are starting to blur together, but hey, my program finally works.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I think pride, I think persistance; I think physical challenge; I think money; I think health. These are all things I have, in the past or present, worked tirelessly on. Each of them fills me with great pride, but not one fills me with happiness. They're too tenuous; your fancy 7-minute-mile will turn back into a 9-minute-mile if you spend too long on the couch.
    </p>
      <p>
      But more importantly, they're each centered around the idea of proving something, either to others or to yourself (think of all those runners running supermarathons--I promise you, no one runs 90 miles straight just because they 'love running').
      And honestly, constantly needing to prove something will make you crazy. It alienates you from other, and it alienates you from yourself. So, on a scale from 1-5, how much do I try to live up to these values? Save for health, which would quite literally be deadly for me to ignore, I'd say...3.
    </p>
    <p>
      But happiness? I can get down with happiness. Here are some words I associate with happiness: growth, self-knowlege, connection, autonomy, vibrancy, openness. These words are about self-betterment without judgement; they're about understanding your strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures, and regarding them with equal respect. You are not trapped in a cycle of trying to prove your worth to others, or to yourself. It's a slower dynamism than the values that result in pride, to be sure, but dymanic nonetheless.

      A friend recently asked me for advice about a work project. Her boss expected too much in too small a time frame; there was no one she could enlist to help her; and her boss was unwilling to extend the time frame or lessen the work load. So, the only way out was through--persistance. She'd have to go through hell, but she'd come out the other side feeling proud she'd made it through. But, I advised, try to find some happiness in the aftermath. Re-attach yourself to the world. Re-attach yourself with yourself.
