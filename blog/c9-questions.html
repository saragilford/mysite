  <h1>Is there Such a Thing as a Stupid Question?</h1>
  <h4>March 15, 2015</h4>

    <p>
    No, there's no such thing as a stupid question.
    </p>
    <p>
    But there are definitely bad questions. Some characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not specific enough</li>
      <li>Doesn't use the right vocabulary (or at least make an attempt to)</li>
      <li>Doesn't give enough background information. What is the ultimate goal you are trying to reach?</li>
      <li>Is working off of entirely incorrect assumptions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That last one was a biggie for me. There have been times where I asked a question based off of an incorrect understanding of a concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to help prevent this is to always explain your ultimate goal first, and then talk through your ideas. Then, others will be able to spot the areas where you don't have quite as strong a handle on the material as you thought you did.
