  <h1>Version Control</h1>
  <h2>Or, how not to lose your mind at 4am</h2>

      Think back to the last time you had to pull an all-nighter for school or work. You've been powering through a spreadsheet or a paper for about 10 hours, and it's about to be light out. You're about half an hour away from being done when--your computer dies. You reboot your computer, and your project is still there! But, it's missing everything you wrote in the last two hours. Commence panic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, think of it from a developer's standpoint. She could be working on a project for weeks, even months, dutifully making changes and improvments to create the best possible piece of code. But one day, she changes the code, and the entire thing stops working. Does she panic? No. Because, she's been using... VERSION CONTROL!

        Version control is a software that allows you to keep track of what changes have been made to your project, whether by you or by any other contributors. Version control also keeps track of different drafts (called "commits"), so that if a change in the current draft messes up your project, you can always go back a previous draft. That's why our developer can keep her cool, even in the face of a major bug.

      So what else is great about version control? Well, it allows you to work better in groups. If you use GitHub, a version control website that uses the version control system "git," you can share your code with anyone you'd like--co-workers, friends, teachers, THE WORLD--and allow them to edit, review, critique, and add to your code. And if you hate their changes, guess what? Version control is your best friend. Just go back to your previous commit. No sweat.
