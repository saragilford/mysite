  <h1>How I'm Feeling about DBC, as of Day 4</h1>

      Honestly, I'm still pretty excited about DBC. I chose this bootcamp over similar programs specifically because it explicitly prioritized empathy, collaboration, communication. Sure, you'll leave with some serious chops, but you'll also have a better understanding of how to wield them. The skills you'll learn won't exist in a vaccum; DBC stresses that they'll have to inhabit the same spaces as human emotion, miscommunications, and systems of power and oppression.

      I think one of the most important takeaways from Shareef's chat was about the right attitude toward tuition. DBC comes with an incredible staff and curriculum, but also a hefty price tag--to say otherwise would be playing it a bit coy. But the best way to think about that investment is as just that--an investment, not a purchase. You can only gain so much if you wait around for what you feel you're owed. You paid a decently sized dump truck of money to be here, so milk the program dry. Ask questions. Get involved. Advocate for yourself. Try new things. Get vulnerable. Get courageous. Get weird.
