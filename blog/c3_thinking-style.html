      Confession: I'm a bit of an astrology hobbyist (read: big nerd). I remember reading about my sign, Libra, for the first time: constantly craving balance, equal parts creative and practical, a dreamer who somehow manages to stay grounded. I remember thinking, "Oh. That makes sense."

        Cut to: three weeks ago. I took a quiz to find out what my Gregorc thinking style is, and I got 'Concrete Random.' Thinkers like me are supposed to love brainstorming a bunch of different ideas, but also designing an explicit way to execute each idea. We enjoy solutions and products that are creative and artful, but also tangible. Yep, it's all very Libra.

        Being a Concrete Random thinker had really helped me so far at DBC. My inclination towards (and patience with, for the most part) trial-and-error is spectacular for coding. </p>

        <p>
          However, I think it hurts me two ways: first, timeboxing (there's always another, better idea to be tried, and how will I know which is best until I try them all????); and second, paying attention to detail (apparently CR thinkers are <a href="http://www.floatingneutrinos.com/Message/arcs/links_on_abstractrandom.htm">"notorious"</a> for skipping instructions, steps, and details, all of which have cost me decent chunks of time completing challenges). The only thing that's worked for me so far to fix this is: JFDI. Just Effing <i>(we're very polite here on my blog)</i> Do It. If I feel myseld pull up directions and start to skim, I stop myself, remember JFDI, and start from the top.

      I think being a Concrete Random thinker is great for a growth mindset. Growth is, after all, trial and error--as long as your are able to learn from your errors.
