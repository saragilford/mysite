  <h1>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h1>
  <h4>March 1, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      You know the old Ruby saying: <i>everything</i> is an object. (While that's not true a full 100% of the time, it gets us by.) But in JavaScript, an object means something very specific.
    </p>
    <p>
       An object in JavaScript is a collection of properties. In other words, it's a variable that contains a bunch of other variables connected to that first variable. Let me show you an example:
    </p>
    <div class="small_code">
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/saragilford/bd36512a1ac178a22fc6.js"></script>
    </div>
    <p>
      Let's diagram this. <tt>simpson</tt> is our object. What makes it an object, as opposed to just a variable, is the fact that it contains multiple properties (<tt>mother, father, sister, brother</tt>). Each property is, in turn, linked to a value (<tt>"Marge", "Homer", "Lisa", "Bart"</tt>).
    </p>
    <p>That means that when we call <tt>console.log</tt> on <tt>simpson["daughter"]</tt> as so...
    <div class="small_code">
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/saragilford/ef45476b21eb5d714884.js"></script>
    </div>
    <p>
      We get the answer <tt>"Lisa"</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does this remind you of anything? How about Ruby hashes? Yup, that's right. Let's check out our favorite family as a hash.
