  <h1>Car Conflict</h1>
  <h4>March 3, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      In my family, we always had car troubles. Namely, we had far more people than cars, and each person had a place to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally it went as follows: the grown-ups had to go to work, so got priority; the teens had to duke it out for a chance at the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, the parents would be the final deciders of who was going to get the car for the evening. How they calculated their decisions could, at times, be a source of pain to me and my brother. One persons' needs, time, and choices could be considered less than the others', which never feels great.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were probably times when I felt I was being ignored, that I could have talked to my parents and brother. I could have explained why certain events were important for me to attend. Just saying, "Hey, it's really important to me to spend time with these friends/go to xyz function because I've been feeling [feeling] and I think going would help me not feel [feeling]." This, of course, should come in tandem with the freedom for my brother to make similar requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, if there is a conflict, sit with yourself and analyze your motives, and then feel comfortable explaining those motives to people.
