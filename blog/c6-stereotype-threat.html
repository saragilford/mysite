  <h1>It's Supposed to Be Hard</h1>
  <h2>Notes on STEM and Stereotype Threat</h2>

      Confession: I quit math in my junior year of high school.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't that math was hard (it was). It was that I thought I was bad at it (I wasn't). Even taking honors trig at 13, I thought I was bad at it. For some reason, math made me feel flawed; my first reaction when working on a tough problem was to ask myself, "Why is this so difficult for me? What's wrong with me that I can't slide through it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It never occured to me that, hey, math is <i>supposed</i> to be hard.

      Looking back, I sometimes wonder how many of the boys in my class asked themselves the same questions. How many of them looked at a knotty assignment and wondered, "Am I stupid?" Honestly, I suspect not that many. When it comes to STEM fields, men are expected to excelâ€”any bumps along the way can be written off as 'process.' Small failures are not often personalized; they are certainly not generalized to apply to their entire gender.
    </p>

      So here's where we get to stereotype threat: the idea that marginalized individuals underperform when they're in an environment where their marginalized identity is made salient. For my high school math career, 'underperforming' was a slow, nearly invisible process. Math felt awful so I didn't work as hard (what was the point, if I was inherently bad at it?); I hadn't worked as hard, so I opted for easier math classes instead of advanced classes; and then, ultimately, I backed out altogether.

      In learning to code, it's essential for me to be vigilant against stereotype threat tainting my learning process. I have to work to not see failing code as personal failure, to not begin the slow process of raising my hands in defeat. It's incredibly helpful to talk to women developers; seeing successful people who share your identity makes it less unbelievable that someone like you could thrive doing something like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for creating an evironment for others to escape stereotype threat, I keep returning to <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/378577902/how-to-become-batman?showDate=2015-01-23">this episode</a> of <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/">Invisibilia</a> about the power of low expectations. It tells the story of Daniel Kish, a blind man who is able to get around (even by bicycle) without assistance. He's a firm believer that blindness only becomes debilitating when others assume it's debilitating. According to Kish, people offering a helpful hand by doing the cooking, cleaning, navigation, and other daily tasks of blind children ultimately do more harm than good. Not only does this "help" rob children of the chance to learn how to perform these tasks themselves; it teaches them that they are fundamentally incapable of performing the tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In creating a safe environment for all to excel, you must be aware of the ways that your unconscious expecations of others affect your actions toward them. Keep this in mind when explaining tough concepts to people, or when you seek someone out to ask for input. Did this person ask for your explanation, or did you assume they'd need a little extra help? When you ask for help or for new ideas, are you always seeking out the same kind of people? If someone that you wouldn't normally seek out offers input, do you take their ideas seriously? Or do you nod politely and go back to your stand-bys?
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not always easy to keep asking yourself these questions. But, much like math and coding itself, it's supposed to be hard.
