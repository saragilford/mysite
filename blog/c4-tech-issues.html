  <h1>What Do You Mean by 'Best'?</h1>
  <h2>Thoughts from a bleeding heart developer</h2>
  <h4>February 4, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Next time you order an Uber, ask your driver who he works for. His answer? Uber, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, ask the same question to Uber's legal team. My Uber driver works for Uber, right? Nope, they'd say. He's self-employed.
    </p>

    <p>
      See, Uber markets itself as simply a software platform—or, according to their lawyers, <a href="http://sfist.com/2015/02/02/will_uber_and_lyft_be_forced_to_tre.php">"an intellectual property company"</a>—one in which those in need of a ride can connect with those willing to drive them. Uber doesn't select or hire drivers directly, and therefore contends to have no obligation to the drivers. Drivers are simply referred to as independent contractors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say we accept the premise that Uber <i>is</i> the OKCupid of hired transport. Here's the thing: OKCupid cannot tell users who to message and when; they cannot terminate your account if you go on a date that turns out to be a dud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uber, on the other hand, <i>can</i> exert this level of control over its drivers. It can control and direct their workflow; it can, without warning, <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/uber-drivers-team-up-with-teamsters-union-5040562">change policies</a> that negatively affect the earnings potential of its drivers; and, most importantly, it <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Internal-Uber-e-mails-reflect-company-s-brash-6051762.php">retains the right</a> to fire its employees at will. (Uber managers refer to this as 'deactivation,' as if it is an equivalent action to removing a spam account from Twitter. This distinction is, to be frank, intellectually dishonest.)
    </p>
    <p>
      So why would Uber cling so hard to the conviction that they are not the employers of their drivers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that's a gimme: money.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-uber-lyft-independent-contractors-20150130-story.html">California courts</a> decide that Uber drivers are employees of Uber, and not just independent contractors, Uber would be on the hook for hourly minimum wage, overtime pay, reimbursement for expenses like gas, and even health benefits for full-time employees. And, considering that as of December of 2014 Uber had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/22/now-we-know-many-drivers-uber-has-and-how-much-money-theyre-making%E2%80%8B/">162,037 'active drivers,'</a> that adds up to a lot of dough. And what's the easiest way to avoid shelling out? Put your hands up and say, 'not mine.'

    <p>
      The tech industry is defined by the ethos that problems are meant to be solved; that there are always interesting, innovative ways of making life better. I worry, though, that there is an incredible complacency when it comes to attacking some of the biggest problems in our world: wealth disparity, racism, sexism, and in the case of Uber, workers' rights. Coders are trained to look at the world unsatisfied with the phrase "that's just the way it is"; but ask tech industry titans about the big stuff? Well, you'll hear, that's just the way it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of creating ethical technology is understanding how your creation interacts with the population at large: not just potential clients, but those who use your technology as a source of personal income, those for whom your product is inaccessible. If your technology is exploits its workers or  puts them at risk, guess what? You're not done debugging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tech needs to recognize that the best possible product is not one built at the expense of non-tech workers. The best possible product cannot exist in a vaccuum outside history, outside wealth disparity, outside the realities of human life. If our idea of best possible product moves the onus away from corportations and onto individual laborers, we have to dream bigger.
