      I'm a blunt girl.
    </p>
    <p>
       This is a point of pride with me. I'm rarely one to sugarcoat—I'd rather just be direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let's not mix up being blunt with being—pardon my French—a total wang. If you constantly shout people down with no regard to their wellbeing, you're not being blunt; you're being a wang. But to me, the most crucial difference between the two is how you react when bluntness—or rather, honesty—is directed at you.

      This week, I recieved anonymous critiques from my people I've paired with since the start of DBC. By and large, I've enjoyed each pairing session. I learn by talking things through, so being able to have someone explain stuff to me or explain a concept to another person really helps my solidify my learning.
    </p>
    <p>
       What was most comforting about the critiques so far is that none of them have caught me completely off guard. I recall one pairing session sort of dragging along—it was early in the week, and neither my pair nor I had a solid enough grasp on the material yet to really get off the ground. So when a piece of feedback came back describing similar feelings, it was comforting to know that I was already aware of problem, that my weakness in a certain area hadn't been a complete blind spot. I think the real work of reading, evaluating, accepting, and implementing criticism will start when I get totally sideswiped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best piece of feedback I got was tech-based: it said I rely on the same methods and approaches, instead of broadening my scope. This is a great tip, and basically just points me back to the books. If I'm not using something, it's probably because I don't fully understand how and when to use it.

      As for writing critique, I think it gets harder and harder to write as you continue pairing with the same people (I switch it up, but always appreciate pairing in person with the one other DBCer who lives in my area). Since many of us are about the same skill level, a lot of pairing critique at this point is working out communication kinks ("I would have appreciated if you would have talked through your ideas more",  "It would be awesome if you could voice when you don't get something", etc). I think the more you work with the same person, the more you smooth out those kinks naturally, and don't have much to say. Maybe as time goes forward, we'll have a keener eye in how to help others shape up technically.
